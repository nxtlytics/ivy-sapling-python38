# Python Application (Docker) Sapling

This repository contains a sapling (skeleton) for building a Python Application in Docker using Pipenv that can be uploaded to a Pypi registry.

Python applications that run in Docker can be deployed to Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or really anywhere!

## Getting started

1. Create a new project based on this sapling.
    * Visit [ivy-sapling-python38/generate](https://github.com/nxtlytics/ivy-sapling-python38/generate) or
    * click "Use this template"

    Proceed to name your new repository

    **Protip**: project names should be short, and descriptive.

2. Clone the resulting project to your computer
    ```
    cd ~/code
    git clone git@github.com:<your-org>/<new-app>.git
    cd <new-app>
    ```

3. Remove this `README.sapling.md` file

4. Edit your dependencies
    * Install dependencies with pipenv e.g., `pipenv install <dependency>`, or
    * edit `Pipfile`

5. Add your code
    * Update a `main.py` in the `src` folder containing your main entrypoint
    * Add your python code and supporting libraries to the `src` folder
    * Run `pipenv lock` to sync your local dependencies from `Pipfile.lock`
      *Dependencies installed, but not listed in your lock file will not be installed in CICD!*

6. Edit the `Dockerfile`
    * Find the latest `nxtlytics/base-python38` image in hub.docker.com ([see here](https://hub.docker.com/r/nxtlytics/base-python38/tags))
      and update the `FROM`
    * Ensure your code is captured in the `ADD` statement
    * Ensure the `CMD` points to your application's entrypoint

7. Commit your code
    * See the section on [Workflow](#Workflow) for Git workflow processes and best practices

8. Add your project to CICD
